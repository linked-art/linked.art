## Project Supported Activities

Due to the impact of COVID-19, the planned Editorial Board meeting and Community Outreach Workshops planned for June and September 2020 have been cancelled. Fortnightly *Exemplar Mapping* calls are continuing ([get involved](/community/#get-involved)) and the project is developing software and practice to take translate the planned modelling workshop activities into virtual events:

- A call for community participation in exemplars will be launched in October 2020
- The project will support Linked Art community presentations and workshops at the virtual [CIDOC 2020 conference](https://cidoc.mahgeneve.news/en/home/), 7th-10th December 2020 (free registration required)
- Online workshops to support the community exemplar call will now take place in January/February 2021

### Linked Art Questionnaire

The Linked Art questionnaire seek views from all interested persons on the use and adoption of Linked Art, particularly of any opportunities and challenges that can be forseen. [Further information](./questionnaire/) 

## Project Abstract

*Linked Art II: Developing Community, Practice, and Scholarship* brings together University researchers with experts from some of the leading art museums in the UK and US. The project will engage with scholars and practitioners to highlight the opportunities afforded by connected collections as data, and establish where new digital methods and tools are needed to enable novel research. Linked Art II will engage with cultural institutions to examine how structured data can contribute towards digital challenges, including improving the accessibility of collections, and increasing the range and diversity of institutions and material available to the public.

The foundation of the project is the development and application of Linked Data to cultural heritage collections, with an emphasis on works of art and their provenance. Linked Data will provide a platform for multi-modal digital scholarship across these rich collections; Linked Art II will continue a partnership setting an international agenda to realise this platform through a common data model, building capacity for future collaborative implementations and research investigations.

In the first phase of this work, a research network was formed to bring together experts who are collaborating on the design of the common data model. The Linked Art II project continues this work, but also seeks to trial and test the model through a series of feasibility studies and proof of concept implementations.

These 'exemplars' will be developed in collaboration with project partners and the wider Linked Art community; two exemplars will be selected via an open call for collaboration. The project will publish documentation and explanation of the exemplars on the Linked Art website so that others can understand and learn about the practicalities of Linked Art adoption.

The project is led by the University of Oxford and the J. Paul Getty Trust, with project partners from the UK and US including: the American Numismatic Society, the National Gallery (London), the National Gallery of Art (Washington D.C.), Newfields, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Smithsonian Institution, the University of the Arts London, the Victoria & Albert Museum, and the Yale Center for British Art.

The project will advocate Linked Art adoption amongst the cultural heritage community in the UK and US through a series of outreach workshops, disseminating discussion points and conclusions from the network in easily understood and readily available forms, and enabling the wider sector to benefit from the transformative step-change offered by Linked Art as it evolves. 

## About the AHRC

The Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) funds world-class, independent researchers in a wide range of subjects: history, archaeology, digital content, philosophy, languages, design, heritage, area studies, the creative and performing arts, and much more. This financial year the AHRC will spend approximately Â£98 million to fund research and postgraduate training, in collaboration with a number of partners. The quality and range of research supported by this investment of public funds not only provides social and cultural benefits and contributes to the economic success of the UK but also to the culture and welfare of societies around the globe.
