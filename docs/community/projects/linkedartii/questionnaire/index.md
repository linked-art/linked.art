The Linked Art questionnaire seek views from all interested persons on the use and adoption of Linked Art, particularly of any opportunities and challenges that can be forseen. 

The questionnaire has been produced by the Linked Art II project at the University of Oxford, and comprises four sections:

* Section 1 - Improving Collections Data
Can Linked Art help improve collections data across institutions?

* Section 2 - Exploring Technical Implementations (optional)
Feedback on interactive notebooks developed by the project to illuminate the process of creating, reconciling, and visualising Linked Art data.

* Section 3 - Opportunities
Your ideas for specific applications of Linked Art which could support your collections data or scholarship, along with an opportunity for the project to help you implement these ideas.

* Section 4 - About Yourself
To help us understand your background and motivations.

The Linked Art questionnaire is open from 5th April 2022 - 8th May 2022.
