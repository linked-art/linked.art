Connecting Cultural Heritage Collections Data"

[TOC]

# Webinar
The AHRC-funded Linked Art II project and Digital Scholarship at Oxford invite you to a webinar at 1-2pm on Tuesday 3 May 2022, to be held on Zoom. The webinar will be of interest to practitioners and scholars working with collections data who wish to learn about software tools, including ‘code notebooks’, which can be used to create and apply Linked Art.

Please register in advance for the webinar using the link below.

## Linked Art
[Linked Art](https://linked.art) is a new data standard being developed to describe artworks and facilitate connections between cultural heritage collections, thereby creating new opportunities for digital discovery and research using this interlinked data.

## Code Notebooks
In this webinar, Research Software Engineer Tanya Gray will guide attendees through a practical exploration of transforming, reconciling, and visualising Linked Art, using real-world data from museums and galleries worldwide. These will be demonstrated using ‘code notebooks’ developed during the Linked Art II project and implemented in Jupyter. The notebooks provide step-by-step illustration and explanation, and can provide a foundation for further customisation.

## Linked Art Questionnaire
The webinar complements a forthcoming public questionnaire about Linked Art, which will [launch in the coming weeks](../questionnaire/) and we would be grateful if you could complete.

## Webinar Q&A
The webinar will end with a Q&A session during which audience members can ask any questions about the code notebooks and forthcoming questionnaire. In addition, speakers will be available to take further questions for 30 minutes following the main webinar (i.e. 2-2.30pm).
