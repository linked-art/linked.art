Linked Art is a [Community](/community/) working together to create a shared [Model](/model/) based on [Linked Open Usable Data](/loud/) to describe cultural heritage, with a focus on artwork but including also archives and bibliographic material. We specify [APIs](/api/) that enable access to data in the model, and implement them in [Software](/software/) to provide valuable content to the world.
